# photoTimestampChanger

This project is just a single little bash script that takes a group of photos and increments (or deincrements) the timestamp by a given value.

Currently the values and directory is hardcoded into the script so you will need to change those before running.

You will also need to calculate the timestamp difference between the correct date (maybe compare with an itinerary or other photos) to work out the correct date.
